Lunarbots
=========

We're building a board game that simulates the bootstrapping of a space industry on the moon, with the aim to inspire kids about space, space exploration and teach basic concepts of logistics, resource management and cooperation.

The design document is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T0XpG3HWHbwFBeVlLM4ptYQAw1wLpmJOEL7cVzK53NQ/edit?usp=sharing and the 3D models of the pieces are available here in this repository in both Maya and STL format for 3D printing.
